# Simulation_low_rank_VAR1

This project is an complementar material for the article 'High dimensional AR processes with low rank transition', by P. Alquier, K. Bertin, P. Doukhan and R. Garnier . It proposed a notebook which implements the algorithms proposed in the article

## Usage

The notebooks used Python 3.6, and some usual packages in Machine Learning and Data Visualisation (jupyter, pandas, numpy and matplotlib). The easiest way to use it is to download [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) which contains the package used in the notebook.

Another way is to install [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/), then to install the required packages using the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) in the console : 

```bash
pip install jupyter
pip install numpy
...
```

Once installed, run Jupyter in the folder where you download the files:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

And select the file 'low rank AR(1) Simulation.ipynb'
